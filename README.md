# Getting started with the Customer List App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
to get started, you have to clone the repo

1. clone the repo $ gh repo clone [Clone the App](https://github.com/dansagam/express-mongo-generator.git)

2. cd into the directory and install the dependencies. By using the npm install on both the server and the client.

3. create the env files by copying all in the env.example files

4. if you have mongodb installed on the machine, you can simply run the npm run server to check the port your app is listening to.

5. stop the server with the CTRL+C, run the to destroy already inserted data and thereafter, use the
   npm run data:destroy
   npm run data:import.

6. To start the run npm run dev to run both the react client server and the node server.
   npm run dev

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
